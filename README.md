## Sparkbox's HTML & CSS Challenge: Retrofit Table-based Layout

INSTRUCTIONS: Coders, start your refactoring!

This challenge posits you against the dreaded table-based layout. Refactor the HTML to a modern approach and add in the appropriate CSS layout if you have time. The design is flexible as well, so if you complete the refactor with time to spare, start updating the look and feel!
